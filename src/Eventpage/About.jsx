          <h4>   Our Story</h4>
<p>The idea for Zevent was born out of a simple frustration — how difficult it was to find and manage events online that actually mattered to you. So, we decided to build a solution. What started as a small passion project quickly grew into a powerful platform fueled by technology, creativity, and the desire to make event experiences better for everyone.

We imagined a space where organizers could have complete control over their events, and attendees could feel confident and excited about participating. A platform where user access is smart and secure, and where event discovery isn’t just a scroll — it's an experience.

<h5>🧩 Personalized Event Access
</h5>
<p>
We understand that not all events are for everyone. Some are private, others public, and many require user-specific access. That’s why we’ve built advanced access control into the core of our system. Only the right people see the right events — simple as that.
</p>
<h5>
🔍 Intelligent Event Discovery
</h5>
<p>Gone are the days of missing out. Zevent’s discovery system connects you with events based on your interests, history, and location. Whether you're into music, tech, sports, art, or local meetups — you'll find something that fits your vibe.
</p>
<h5>🔒 Secure, Modern Authentication</h5>
<p>We take user security seriously. With JWT-based login, HTTPS-only cookie handling, and local storage for tokens, Zevent ensures your data and access remain protected — whether you're a host or a guest.
